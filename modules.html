        </div>
        
        <p>Khan Academy’s “Intro to HTML/CSS” course covered a thorough introduction to various HTML and CSS concepts that can be used for making web pages. Topics such as font-size, font-type, showing/formatting images, adding hyperlinks, and positioning various elements on the page were covered in-depth, allowing the user to emerge from the course well-equipped to design their own basic webpage.
          <br><br>Personally, a big takeaway from this module was the knowledge of building a basic website. As a student, it is really important to be able to express my thoughts in a meaningful way, recognizing that everyone learns and absorbs information differently. A website is a really good way to have a multimedia platform. Using a website, I can combine text, images, links to external sources, and videos all into one platform. Through the HTML/CSS course, I saw connections not only to ICS4U, but also my learning beyond this class as this is definitely a presentation form that I can use to be successful as a student.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="subtitle">Intro to JS</h3>
        
        <div id="KAvideo2">
          <video width="320" controls autoplay loop>
            <source src="fish_tank.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>
        
        <p>Working through Khan Academy’s “Intro to JS” course taught me the fundamentals of javascript - this course was my first exposure to javascript, so I learned everything from this course. I learned about for, while, and do while loops, variables (global vs local and the scope of a variable), arrays, and most importantly, incorporating all of these principles to form animations! Throughout this course, I learned just how important the draw function really is to the success of a program. Without the draw function, a function in JS that loops continuously, animations would not really work in the same way.
          <br><br>The biggest thing that I took with me throughout ICS4U from this module was making buttons using the mouseClicked function. Since I learned about this important function, there has not been a single JS program that I have written that hasn’t included a mouseClicked function - that’s how vital it is to the success of programs! Eliminating buttons from a program really cuts down on the amount of user interaction that you can incorporate, and less user interaction generally means a less engaging, useful, and meaningful site.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="subtitle">Advanced Games and Visualization</h3>
        
        <div id="KAvideo1">
          <video width="320" controls autoplay loop>
            <source src="hoppy_beaver.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>
        
        <p>This module, “Advanced JS: Games and Visualization”, provided in-depth lessons on advanced javascript concepts. For example, topics such as rotating and scaling shapes with pushMatrix() and popMatrix() were covered, in addition to using a counter variable to code various scenes in a program, and most importantly, object-oriented programming.
        <br><br>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a necessity when programming in javascript. By using OOP, I am able to assign properties to an object as well as methods. OOP really pushed me to realize the potential of reusable code and its importance. If you create an object with different methods and properties, you can code it such that it accepts parameters, and then, if you need more than one instance of that object, that is possible in 1 line of code, where you create a new version of the object and pass in the appropriate parameters. The code is now more reusable, and less code means less memory and time needed to process the code on your computer. This aspect of this module helped me to grow as a computer scientist.
        <br><br>Finally, I learned the important difference between computer science and computer programming. Computer science is using your knowledge of computer programming principles to determine the most efficient way of coding an aspect of your program. There are SO many different ways to code things, so as a computer scientist, you really have to sort out the best, or most efficient solution. Then, you can use computer programming to implement the idea. In short, not only was learning how to use object-oriented programming a key takeaway, but also learning how to think like a computer scientist before a computer programmer.
        <br><br>This attitude of determining the best approach to a problem will really help me as a student. No matter what you’re doing - coding, solving a cube, solving a math problem, or practicing an instrument - you need to start by figuring out what is the best approach? What are good first steps? This is just one way that I can continue to use computer science as I learn.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="subtitle">Natural Simulations</h3>
        
        <div id="KAvideo2">
          <video width="320" controls autoplay loop>
            <source src="paint_splatter.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>
        
        <p>Khan Academy’s “Natural Simulations” course covered a variety of concepts to simulate aspects of nature. For example, I learned how to simulate various forces, such as gravity and wind, as well as acceleration and oscillation. Noise and Randomness were also covered. There were many connections to my grade 11 physics class, which helped to solidify my understanding in both classes.
        <br><br>A huge takeaway for me was learning how to code very realistic and modern applications. For instance, if you think about video games nowadays, they appear to be very life-like by mimicking the movement and behaviour of creatures. Knowing what I now know about these behaviours, I am able to build apps that are much more creative, which draws in user attention. 
        <br><br>Also, I really appreciated the unit about forces. In every program that simulates nature, gravity, wind, and air resistance are present, but before this unit, these were really difficult concepts to code; determining the appropriate values such that the program resembled reality was no small chore. Now, as I mentioned, understanding the mathematical concepts from this unit can help me as a programmer develop better applications that any user can enjoy.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="subtitle">Computer Science Principles: Programming</h3>
        
        <div id="KAvideo1">
          <video width="320" controls autoplay loop>
            <source src="ap_comp_sci_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>
        
        <p>Khan Academy’s course, “Computer Science Principles: Programming”, provided a really thorough exploration of basic, less language-specific, computer science principles. For example, this module dove into variables, arrays, for loops, while loops, conditionals, and procedures. These are really fundamental concepts that you must understand, off of which you can build your knowledge.
        <br><br>Personally, a big takeaway was learning about various string operations in javascript, such as concatenation (merges two or more strings together and returns the combined string) and slicing (returns a substring between specified indices). To me, the other concepts in this course were more or less covered in Khan Academy’s “Intro to JS” course, but the string operations were new. String operations allow the programmer to change the data stored in the string, which can be helpful for many programs. For instance, to display someone’s name from a database, the programmer could easily create a variable that holds the client’s first name, space, last name, using the string operation of concatination to merge all 3 strings into 1 string, and then display that variable to the screen. This would be a lot easier than always having to display all 3 strings (first name, space, and last name) each time you want to display the person’s full name. This was a key takeaway for me from this module.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="subtitle">Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data</h3>
        
        <div id="KAvideo2">
          <video width="320" controls autoplay loop>
            <source src="app.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>
        
        <p>The final module of the course that I completed was “Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data”, which was offered by Khan Academy. By working through this module, most students learn how to manage a database. This entails creating tables, and populating them by inserting rows, joining tables using various join statements, and maybe most importantly, learning how to filter the displayed rows and columns using the where/and/or operators.
        <br><br>While I found all of this to be extremely useful and important, I actually found that the last part of the module was the biggest takeaway for me. At the very end of the course, I learned how to use the keywords “update” and “delete”. The keyword “update” will modify a row of data that has already been inserted into the table, while “delete” will delete a row in the table. I found these to be the biggest practical application of SQL. SQL is used for databases, such as on apps that keep track of usernames/first names/last names, or even a user’s highscore in a game, and in these real-life settings, you want to be able to modify an entry that already exists, not just insert new ones all of the time. These two concepts helped make the course feel more engaging, gave me a better appreciation for all of the behind-the-scenes in some of the most basic apps, and left me with a better foundation for my future coding endeavours.

      <div id="Hackathon">
        <h2>Hackathon</h2>
        
        <div id="KAvideo1">
          <video width="320" controls autoplay loop>
            <source src="hackathon.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>
        
        <p>In general, working through the hackathon really helped to solidify many of the concepts learned while completing “Intro to HTML/CSS”, “Intro to JS”, and “Advanced Games and Visualizations”. The hackathon provided a concrete application for computer science principles, like variables, arrays, functions, for and while loops, and if statements. In addition, the hackathon was a group project, so time management and teamwork were learned and further perfected through this module.
        <br><br>On a personal level, I learned a really important lesson about coding as a student. It can be easy to feel, as a student, that there is no way that we can use the little bit of knowledge that we have to make the world a better place, but the hackathon proved otherwise. A key takeaway from the hackathon was learning that students, like me, can use some of these basic computer science principles to program an application that has the potential to solve a real-world issue. As a student, I can use my critical thinking, not just in computer science but in any subject, to identify an issue plaguing society, and create the solution. This made the hackathon one of my favourite modules to complete in ICS4U.

      </div>
        
        
        <p>For the coding challenge, I worked through professor Dan Schiffman’s tutorial to code the game Snake. I definitely expanded on my knowledge of object-oriented programming and refactoring, which is really important for making code reusable and run smoothly. In addition, I also learned a lot about the cartesian plane and scaling objects. For this particular coding challenge, it was instrumental to think of the snake as fitting within the cartesian plane by using a cartesian coordinate system to ensure that the snake was perfectly aligned with the food. This was not a concept that I had ever really explored in computer science, and I learned lots from the process.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

          </video>
      </div>
        
        <p>During the presentation portion of the coding challenge, I learned a lot by helping classmates work through code and also working through my classmates’ code. I have discovered that it is much different to be able to code something by yourself than to explain it to someone and guide them through it. I learned how to clearly describe my creative thought process to the people around me, and how best to help others’ through my code by using comments, code snippets, writing out detailed step by step instructions, and also live coding together since everyone learns differently (i.e. reading the steps, listening to the steps, seeing it coded, etc.). I know that by having the knowledge to be able to explain and walk colleagues through my code, I will be more successful later on if I’m working in a software development environment, or really no matter the workplace (since this is a very transferable skill).

      <div id="GitHub">
        <h2><br>GitHub Courses and Git Branching</h2>
        
        <div id="KAvideo2">
          <img src="github_courses.png" width="320">
        </div>
        
        <p>When looking at the GitHub courses and Git Branching, most students would say that they learned how to use markdown, which is a language for styling text, and how to use some of GitHub’s most basic features. For example, this course covered issues (allow you to identify problemsbugs in your code), pull requests (allows you to check with others before merging different branches, or a set of changes), and more. While this is all good and true, to me, completing the GitHub courses gave me something bigger and deeper.
        <br><br>Through GitHub’s courses, I learned how I can actively contribute to the coding community. Before the courses, I knew nothing about pull requests, the GitHub project boards, wiki, issues, and most importantly, version control. How can I possibly contribute to the coding community in a meaningful way if I don’t have the knowledge on how to share my code on a platform like GitHub? Working through these courses and learning these skills marks an important milestone in how I can share my work with a huge community of coders, and this was a tremendous takeaway from this module, for me.

      <div id="CodingSession">
        <h2>Creative Coding Session</h2>
        
        <div id="KAvideo1">
          <video width="320" controls autoplay loop>
            <source src="coding_session.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </div>
        
        <p>Working through the coding session was a really educational experience for me. In general, this module focused on javascript, and solidified my understanding of concepts, like constructors, using a counter variable to perform scene changes, if statements, and more. However, I learned a lot more during my creative refactorings.
        <br><br>Performing creative refactorings, both object-oriented and functional, is something that requires practice - coding an idea from scratch and coding an idea from starter code are very different things! Because of all the coding I’d done on Khan Academy prior to completing this module, I was very familiar with coding my ideas from scratch since Khan Academy does not provide starter code for the projects. So, to come up with new refactorings that work with the original code was a bit of a challenge. This is, however, a very real-life application. Software engineers often work on a project in large groups, but each member is tasked to code a certain part of it. At the end of the day, each team member’s piece of code must fit together to create a functional product, and you can’t modify/change the function of a colleague’s code so that your snippet works. Learning the process for working through creative refactorings and building my part of the bigger picture such that it worked together with the starter code was a really key takeaway for me that I have applied not only throughout the course, but that I will apply in future years down the road.
